Gent: !no! I was waiting for you...

:bf:  !no! How did you?!

Gent: !no! I know when this sorts of events will happen. Your girlfriend isn't the first
 one captured by Lomelia.

Gent: !no! Don't worry little boy, I won't stand in your way of saving your dear lover, 
 but you did interupt my study hour, so I must punish you...

:bf: !no! Really...

:bf: !th! I can do this, just don't stess out. I hardly can stay calm when my Girlfriend
 isn't near me...
